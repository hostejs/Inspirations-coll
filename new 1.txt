	- Inventing on Principle
		- Although code had increasingly become the tool of choice for creating dynamic behavior, it remained one of the worst tools for understanding it.
		- show that you could mitigate that problem by making the connection between a system’s behavior and its code immediate

	- The model becomes the detailed blueprint that the computer would use to do the actual programming

	- language was invented by Leslie Lamport, a Turing Award–winning computer scientist
	- He tried also not to use the terms "formal," "verification," or "proof," which reminded programmers of tedious classroom exercises. Instead, he presented TLA+ as a new kind of "pseudocode," a stepping-stone to real code that allowed you to exhaustively test your algorithms—and that got you thinking precisely early on in the design process. "Engineers think in terms of debugging rather than ‘verification,’" he wrote, so he titled his internal talk on the subject to fellow Amazon engineers "Debugging Designs."
